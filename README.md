#### Analysis of the phyllosphere and soil bacterial communities 
#### Data type: Miseq 16S amplicon sequencing data
###### Note 1: Due to the number of samples, different sampling sites and several years of sampling, the samples have been randomly sequenced by multiple sequencing runs.
###### Note 2: The present analyses have been performed on demultiplexed sequence data of only one sampling site (ACA).
#
#### Steps of data analysis:
- DADA2 analysis of different sequening runs individually and merge the final results of multiple runs
- Quality control, denoising and cleaning data
- Explanatory analysis of the non-treated (control) samples
- Explanatory analysis of the phyllosphere samples
- Differential expression analysis of the phyllosphere samples
- Explanatory analysis of the soil samples
- Differential expression analysis of the soil samples
