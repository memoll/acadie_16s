#### Analysis of the phyllosphere and soil bacterial communities 
#### Data type: Miseq 16S amplicon sequencing 
###### Note 1: Due to the number of samples and several years of sampling, the collected data comes from three different sequencing runs.
###### Note 2: The present analyses have been performed on demultiplexed sequence data.

#### Steps of data analysis:
- DADA2 analysis 
- Quality control, denoising and cleaning data
- Explanatory analysis of the phyllosphere samples
- Differential expression analysis of the phyllosphere samples
- Explanatory analysis of the soil samples
